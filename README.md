This project is developed using HTML, Angular JS and FOUNDATION framework for CSS on the client side and PHP on the server side and MySQL as the database.

###PREREQUISITES

Any server that supports PHP and MySQL is needed, I used XAMPP server which comes inbuilt with both MySQL and PHP 

###GETTING STARTED
Step1: The web application is initiated with the index.html file which gives an option to the user to log in or register.
Step2:The registration has all the validations features along with password strength. 
After registration, the user needs to log in using the email and password the validation features were also added to the login module which helps the user to give the right credentials.
After loging in initially, the user will have options to create groups and then the user can add new contacts to them using the plus button or edit the group name or delete it using the pencil or trash button respectively. 
You can view the contacts in a group using the expand button. You can also see all the contacts in every group using the All contacts button in the top Groups is the default page.
